# **Club Organizers**

## **Overview**  
Club Organizers is a web app built to help University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa students find and manage Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs). With over 150 clubs on campus, it provides a streamlined way to explore, join, or administer student groups—all under one platform.

## **My Contributions**  
I focused on backend configuration and deployment, including:
- Supabase database setup and schema design
- Vercel deployment and `.env` variable management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD with Playwright and ESLint integration

I also participated in bug fixing, documentation, and final milestone QA testing.
